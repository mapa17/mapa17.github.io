# EESTech Challenge - Digital Factory Hackathon
I had the opportunity to participate yesterday in the [EESTech Challenge](https://eestechchallenge.eestec.net)
focused around the topics of Industry 4.0 hold at the UPV Valencia.

My colleague Asier and I where working the whole day; under the influence of
much less coffee and energy drinks than I expected, on coming up with a design
solution for automatizing a beer producing company with three different factories.

The fruits of our labor can be found [here](https://github.com/mapa17/eestech_challenge_2k19_VLC), containing
the slides of our final presentation, but more interesting and funny I guess a
recording of ourselves trying to explain our ideas.

It has been the first Hackathon I have ever participated in, and I must say I
would have hoped for a more technical (i.e. engineering/programming) focused exercise,
but it was interesting to think about the something completely different topic for
a moment and to see how one can translate knowledge from one area into another.

In addition I again am very very much impressed about how nice and easy it is to
generate nice looking images with [draw.io](www.draw.io). I love this application :)
