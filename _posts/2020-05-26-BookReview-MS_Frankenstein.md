# Prelude
This is one of those books that I had bought because it is considered a classic and was probably mentioned in some philosophy or literature class. Few years ago I remember to have picked it up for the first time, but dropped it quickly after reading the first paragraph of the introduction. I was astonished and shocked by the difficult wording and unusual vocabulary.
In addition I somehow had the impression that I knew the book, without ever reading a summary or watching a movie; although I am sure I have seen several motion pictures that one could claim, have strong similarities to the work.

Well I was mistaken, concerning the difficulties I would have to read the work and even more concerning its content (for those not reading further. Frankenstein is not the name of the monster, but its creator).

# En breve - SPOILER ALERT
Frankenstein, a young and brilliant scientists gives life to a creature of his own creation, but abandons it shortly after as he deems the poor wretch to be more monster than man. The creature left to itself, learns to survive on its own and masters the human language, but fails to find companionship as where ever it goes is received with despise, fear and aggression.

Frustration turns into despair and despair into fury, under which the creature kills one of Frankensteins siblings and threatens its creator to do much worse if he refuses to create a female companion for his creation. Although Frankenstein accepts at first, changes his mind and refuses to complete his promise, being concerned that giving life to another monster will make him the father of a new species of monsters that soon would flourish and might destroy all of mankind. 

The create keeping its promise and realizing its threats, fills its creators life with pain and sorrow, killing all but one of his friends and families. Frankenstein with nothing else worth living, devotes the rest of this life to hunting the beast and follow it around the world. 

Many years later, between ice and snow in the norths of russia, the hunt comes to an end, with Frankenstein dying of exhaustion and bitterness. His creature obsessed with only one things, to extend the pain and suffering of its creator, on loosing him, similar looses all purpose of life and makes an end to is missaral existenz.


# Thoughts and Conclusion
The novel was published in 1818 and in many ways discusses the dangers of scientific progress. Exactly this believe and notion of progress, is what is discussed in [Neil Postmanns - Building a Bridge ot the 18th century](./BookReview-NP_Building_a_Bridge_to_the_18th_century/) that I reviewed recently. I wonder to which extend this concept of progress is part of the problem; to which extend continuos improvement as an obligation, is driving the use of technologie and research into self-destruction. Frankenstein is obsessed with exploring new frontiers, of being the creator of a new species, and to advance human knowledge at any cost.

What can we learn from Frankensteins fate? Could he have changed the outcome of his story, by being more cautious, by being less secret about this work, or was he doomed from the beginning? Was there something wicked about his endeavour, or was it the sheer the lack of luck?

Concerning Frankenstein, the person, it is hard to imagen a man with less strength of character, and tendency to histeria and self pity. Only after most of his family and friends where killed, he manages to make public the existence of his creation and overcome his self pity of being the origin of death and the pain of so many. I wonder to which extend, this incompetence to make public his own failures, to clean up his own mess, and to act in general are the reasons of his downfall. Are those the vices, that weight heavier than the desire to explore human knowledge without constrains, reflection or boundaries? Frankenstein compares himself to a poor woman being send to death for a crime that is not of her doing, and seems to conclude that he as the real origin of the crime wondering around free is much worse off. That there lies more pain in living with his wrongdoing than being send to death innocent. 

But what would the novel be like with a strong Frankenstein? With someone that can overcome his self pity and fear to acknowledge a mistake in order to save further pain and resolve the problem?

How should or would a modern researcher striving to develop general artificial  intelligence (gAI) (i.e. a thinking, living and maybe feeling creatures) face this challenge and its dangerous? I have not seen Shelley's work to be included in the discussion about the consequences and the dangers of working on gAI, but after reading Frankenstein, the similarities between the two seem shockingly clear.

If researchers, one day will achieve to give birth to a creature with the potential to sustain itself, to think and reflect, to learn and prosper, how will they control and relate to it? Will they cast away their creation the same way as Frankenstein did? Will they as well failed to find beauty and decency in their own creation? Frankenstein and all others in the novel, condemned the creature to death, pain and solitude based not on its actions, but on its nature alone.

One can imagen modern Ai research to be less secretive and more responsible than Frankenstein, but would it be less human centric? Would man be less cruel to its own creation than history has shown over and over again, we have been to one another?
