# Prelude
I had this book lying around for a long time, and have long forgotten why I bought it in the first place. I can remember vaguely to have read another work by Postman, maybe [Amusing ourselves to death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amusing_Ourselves_to_Death)? but if so I must have lost the book or have completely forgotten about it.

Even more surprised I was, to find this book to by very interesting and entertaining; at least at the beginning. The first three chapters and chapter six on *Narratives* are very much worth reading. Concerning the rest of the book it is filled with general pessimism about technology broadly and about anything with a screen in particular.

# Main message
In 1999 Neil Postman paints a very dark picture of the achievements of the closing 20th century and of what is to come for the opening 21th.

His claims that
* We have to look for idols and guidance not in the present or recent history but to the figures of the enlightenment.
* Modern society is too technocentric, missing the fundamental values and concepts of wisdom, egalitarian, education, childhood and public discourse that the enlightenment created.
* Only be studying history and combining the best ideas of the enlightenment with the experience and hindsight of the failures of the 20th century will mankind prosper in the next one. 

# Chapter Summary
The book starts out very nicely quoting from Edna St. Vincent Millay's work *Huntsman What Quarry?* the following poem that summarizes many aspects of what to come

<p style="text-align: center;">
<i><b>
  Upon this gifted age, in its dark hour,<br>
  Rains from the sky a meteoric shower<br>
  Of facts ... they lie unquestioned, uncombined.<br>
  Wisdom enough to leech us of our ill<br>
  Is daily spun; but there exists no loom<br>
  To weave it into fabric.
  </b>
</i>
</p>

Postman continues ...

*No loom to weave facts into fabric, people with no gods to serve, hollow and anxious, distrusting language, uncertain about even the most obvious features of reality, lacking conviction, suspicious of truth.*

This nicely states the essence of the problem that Postman identifies in modern society. A society full of potential that has been refined over the century through technological progress, but has lost its ways during the last century focusing increasingly on technology to answer questions of moral, values, purpose and the fabric of reality.

## I : A Bridge to the 18th Century
Many of our opinions on equality of race, gender and origin, as well as our collective perspective on the positive effect of education are concepts that have been developed during the enlightenment. An epoch lasting without clear boundaries between 1650-1790 (Newtons Principia Mathematica until the outbreak of the french revolution).

A time of great thinkers like Goethe, Voltaire, Rousseau, Diderot, Kant, Hume, Gibbon, Pestalozzi and Adam Smith, or the the american founding fathers Thomas Paine, Jefferson, Adams and Franklin. The period in history that gave birth to ideas about the scientific method and inductive science, popular education, the nation state, and rational commerce.

A time when modern western societies and moral standards where formed, despite slavery and inequality being the natural state of things.

## II: Progress - Rationalism and Romanticism
The scientific progress in the natural sciences of the renaissance continued throughout the enlightenment and formed our modern concept of *progress*. Of mankind progressing through time, advancing step by step towards a better future.

This notion of progress has not existed before, but rather people expected cyclical patterns of the birth, prospering and decline. Ranging from nation states, individuals and all living things in general.

Encouraged by the progress in natural sciences and physics in particular, the thinkers of the enlightenment imagined that they would be with able at some point to understand and explain every aspect of human life. To find the laws that govern human behavior, moral and maybe even god itself. They put *reason* at the center of progress and made it the judge and executioner over all that can be known. This movement we now call **Rationalism**, promptly produced its counter movement, the **Romanticism**.

Jean-Jacques Rousseau is the founding figure of **Romanticism** that at its core, questions the progress in human morality that Rationalism proclaimed. Romanticism is skeptical towards the absolute application or reason as the looking glass through which to observe and understand the world. The romantic thinkers believe that one needs a fundamental to stand on, and from which to judge and try to understand the world. This fundament has to be spirituality and a maybe religion, but cannot be reason alone. 

This discourse between Rationalism and Romanticism, combining reason and spirituality are at the hearth of the enlightenment and should be inspiration to us for our own times and the future ahead.

## III: Technology and the Internet
Postman has written several critics of the miss use of modern technologies and media (television, internet, and would he write today, most probably smartphones).
It is therefore no surprise that technology and the internet in particular, he deems as a bad influence on mankind and its future.

Taking a step back he claims, and rightly so, that technology is neither intrinsically good nor bad, but foremost a tool, and while new tools can bring new benefits and powers, they can cause destruction and pain in often equal measures. With all new tools its therefore important to ask who is going to enjoy the benefits, and who is going to pay the bill and suffer the pain that technological revolutions bring about.

## IV & VIII: Language - Newspapers and civil discourse
The enlightenment is not only a time of scientific revolution, but as well a revolution in language. Its at the end of the 17th century that the vernacular languages become the norm in which scientific and popular literature is written. The time when philosophers and scientists changed their style and writing from latin with a focus on form to their local vernacular with a focus on ease of understanding and clear writing.

A new form of civil discourse is developed in the shape of newspapers that are created in the hundreds in every nation, and the opening of saloons and coffee shops that where used by the public to exchange ideas, hold discussion and relate to the world.

In contrast to today, believing Postman, even less prominent in the future a single news article could reach significant parts of a nation, and induce discussions at all levels of society, uniting a nation and its people.

Will the future have such platforms of civil discourse? Will we still see individual articles that grab the attention and the hearts of a nation? How will a public discourse look like if there is no common set of references and narratives that people can relate to?

Postman claims that technology and the internet in particular, despite its capability to connect people and encourage communication will produce the reverse and instead isolate people even more. If so, he worries than Democracy by itself would be at stack, as public discourse stands at the hearth of Democracy, and the internet is creating a fractured public that has no common ground nor medium of exchange.

## VI: Narrative - Shared culture, purpose and vision
I specially enjoyed this chapter, reminding me of Jordan Peterson with its focus on Narrative as the backdrop and the context of our lives and society as a whole.

A nations narrative grows naturally over centuries and millennia, describing what life is like and what it is about. It is the corpus of stories that make up the cultural basis of a nation, and Postman sees national narratives in wester world dying out. He claims that people don't know their national narratives anymore; how could it be otherwise, because of doing too little reading. Postman claims that people are missing exactly that shared cultural context and references, that serve to keep national narratives alive and evolving.

The result is confusion and the lack of vision as a nation and in the lives of its citizens. Like a ship without a captain floating on open sea, looking in vain for a coast line or a light tower to orientate and direct itself.


## VII & IV: Children & Education
 Postman claims that childhood as we have come to know it is dissapearing, because of children having access to an unfiltered view of the world through modern television and the internet. Such an unfiltered view would rob them of their innocent perspective on life and the world, effectively destroying the protected time and space we to call childhood.

The book ends with a discussion about the role and goal of education, which for Postman lies in the creation of a skeptical mind. Exactly that, learning to be skeptical about tradition and the unreflected life, is what the philosophers of the enlightenment brought to the table, and following Postman we needed to go forward into the future.

# Conclusion
Is he right? Is Postman correct in believing that people are less reflective today than they have been in the 18th century, and that reading about philosophers ideas and discourses would teach us a mindset that would serve us well in solving the problems of the 21th century?

I believe that we need platforms that enable the coordination and discourse of different interest groups on a national and global level. The 21th century will surly provide complex challenges that cannot, or better, should not be solved by a small circle of intellectual elites. 

Democracy as it has been developed in the 18th century might now be the best way to govern the nation states or a constellation of states of the future. We should not bound future generations to retain Democracy as we came to know it and some of its concurring structures, like public newspapers.

I think it should be our goal to develop societies that support diverse styles of lives and thinking within a common structure that ensures the protection of the weakest elements of society and balances person flourishing and equality of opportunity.

I am less sure about the role culture, and in particular tradition can, or should play in the future. Are national traditions and national cultures essential for people to find their identity and experience grounding? Looking at attempts in the 20th centuries to shape culture or even eradicate it, either in the UdSSR or in communist china, produced nothing but tremendous suffering and pain.

How much shared culture is needed to hold a society together, and to enable discussion and politics or democracy?
