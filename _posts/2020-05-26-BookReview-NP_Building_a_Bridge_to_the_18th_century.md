# Prelude
I had this book lying around for a long time, and have long forgotten why I bought it in the first place. I can remember vaguely to have read another work by Postman, maybe [Amusing ourselves to death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amusing_Ourselves_to_Death)? but if so I must have lost the book or have completely forgotten about it.

Even more surprised I was than, to find this book to by very interesting and entertaining at first. The first three chapters and chapter six on *Narratives* are very much worth reading. Concerning the rest of the book it is filled with general pessimism about technology broadly and about anything with a screen in particular.

# Main message
In 1999 Neil Postman paints a very dark picture of the achievements of the closing 20th century and of what to look forward in  the opening 21th.

His main points are
* We have to look for idols and guidance not in the present or recent history but to the figures of the enlightenment.
* Modern society is too technocentric, missing the fundamental values and concepts of wisdom, egalitarian, education, childhood and public discourse that the enlightenment created.
* Only be studying history and combining the best ideas of the enlightenment with the experience and hindsight of the failures of the 20th century will mankind prosper in the next one. 

# Content
The book starts out very nicely quoting from Edna St. Vincent Millay's work *Huntsman What Quarry?* the following poem that summarizes many aspects of what to come

<p style="text-align: center;">
<i>
  Upon this gifted age, in its dark hour,<br>
  Rains from the sky a meteoric shower<br>
  Of facts ... they lie unquestioned, uncombined.<br>
  Wisdom enough to leech us of our ill<br>
  Is daily spun; but there exists no loom<br>
  To weave it into fabric.
</i>
</p>

Postman continues

*No loom to weave facts into fabric, people with no gods to serve, hollow and anxious, distrusting language, uncertain about even the most obvious features of reality, lacking conviction, suspicious of truth.*

This nicely states the problem that Postman identifies in modern society. A society full of potential that has been developed over the century through technological progress, but has lost its ways during the last century focusing more and more on technology without moral values that help to guide ones life and perception of reality.

## I : A Bridge to the 18th Century
Many of our opinions on equality of race, gender and origin or our opinion on the positive effect of education are concepts that have been developed during the enlightenment lasting without clear boundaries between 1650-1790 (Newtons Principia Mathematica until the outbreak of the french revolution).

It was the time of great thinkers like Goethe, Voltaire, Rousseau, Diderot, Kant, Hume, Gibbon, Pestalozzi and Adam Smith. Of the founding fathers Thomas Paine, Jefferson, Adams and Franklin. The time when we developed the ideas about scientific method and inductive science, popular education, the nation state, and rational commerce.

A time when slavery and inequality was the natural state of things, but that started to form our ideas about modern societies and our moral standards.

## II: Progress - Rationalism and Romanticism
The scientific progress in the natural sciences of the renaissance continued throughout the enlightenment and formed our modern concept of *progress*. Of mankind progressing through time, advancing step by step towards a better future.

This notion of progress has not existed before, but rather people expected cyclical patterns; the birth, prospering and decline of states, individuals and things in general.

Encouraged by the progress in physics and mathematics, the thinkers of the enlightenment imagined that they would be with time able to understand and explain every aspect of human life. To find the laws that govern human behavior, moral and maybe even god. They put *reason* at the center of progress and made it the judge over all questions. This movement was later named **Rationalism** and promptly produced its counter movement, **Romanticism**.

Jean-Jacques Rousseau is the founding figure of **Romanticism** that at its core, questions the progress in human morality that the Rationalism proclaimed. Romanticism is skeptical towards the absolute application or reason as the looking glass with which to observe and understand the world. The romantic thinkers believe that one needs a fundamental to stand on, and from which to judge and try to understand the world. This fundament has to be spirituality and a maybe religion, but cannot be reason alone. 

This discourse between Rationalism and Romanticism, combining reason and spirituality are at the hearth of the enlightenment and should be inspiration to us for our own times and the future ahead.

## III: Technology
Not good or bad, but a tool, and neither its benefits nor its deficiencies are felt equally by everyone.

## IV & VIII: Language - Newspapers and civil discourse

## VI: Narrative - 
p101
The human mind needs a narrative to give purpose and order to life. Narratives are constructed and fluctuate throughout history. They are the result of not a single person or event, and are in constant flux.
