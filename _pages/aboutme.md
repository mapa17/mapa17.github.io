Hi,
born and raised in Vienna I was fascinated and captivated by computers from an
early stage. Growing up in a typical workers family I got to know computers as
mostly as a gaming platform, and I can remember to have bothers my parents for
ages (well at around twelve it felt like ages at least) to buy me one.

Shortly after getting my first computer (AT&T machine with intel i486@100Mhz and 8MB Ram)
I started to play around with the operating system and the DOS console. There
was this one game that I wanted to play, but it needed more memory to run than
my machine head, so I stared to play around with some system commands (memset???),
and even remember to have been able to run it once, but in the processes destroyed
the system more than once. Maybe my parents at some point decided that they had
payed enough for some computer repair service guy to come and fix it, or was it
me who was bothering them again, but I started to go to some after school computer
classes and that i guess was the first time that i got real schooling on the subject.

The most important single event for my future career and decision to really go
into computer science and become a software developer, happened a few years later thought.
I guess I was around 14 or 15 when a good friend of mine got as a present a programming book for kids.

I dont know how it ended up with me, but soon after I started to write my first
C programs in Borland C++ compiler (for DOS, for some reason I can remember ...)

Well from there on I was hooked and have not stopped programming since.

Much later I started a university program in Vienna (physics and technical informatics,
dropping physics after two sad years of a lot of work and little progress ... ),
finished my Masters in Parallel and Distributed computing in València (Spain) and
worked for years as a Scientific Software Engineer at the Vienna Biocenter, writing
software for scientists to analyze their data.

There first few years where very exciting and motivating, the idea to be supporting
science, to be on the front of research, to do something to help human kind. It
was all very fascinating. I never had anything to do with Biology in my life and
being inspired by a friend of mine that I once visited in her lab in the last weeks
in my time in València, I decided to apply my computer science skill for the good
of human kind :)

Well I grew up at some point I guess and realized basic research is a tough and
very competitive field. Although I did not do research my own, I saw many poor
PhD’s sufferings for years, and an environment that should push people continuously
over their limits and forced them to generate data and results that would be worth
publishing in only the best of journals.

Well in order to shorten a boring story, I decided it would be time for a change,
and followed up on a passion and interest of mine. I enrolled in another master
program in Spain, this time in artificial intelligence.

That’s where I stand at the moment. Lets see what the future brings …
